    <h3>WHAT IS A KEYGEN?</h3>
     <p>
KeyGen (Key-Gen) stands for key-generator. 
It is a small piece of software that enables users to activate and/or patch a determined software in order to use it without purchasing it. It’s an illegal and unethical hacking practice that involves the stealing of intellectual property and it has evolved and survived even in the modern and sophisticated technologies.
     </p>
     <p>
Before the up to date technologies and fast broadband, piracy was carried through physical mediums and hardware but nowadays it takes place vastly on the internet. Hacking a software to reverse-engineer its protection is an extremely difficult process that the majority of the times is performed by a group of anonymous hackers under the same name (hacking teams).
     </p>
     <h3>WHAT IS THE CORRELATION OF A KEYGEN WITH ART?</h3>
     <p>
When those teams successfully hack a piece of software, they celebrate by adding a theme song to its relative KeyGen. The particularity of those compositions is that they all resemble the same timbra even if they are completely different genres because it subverts the original sound. This is because those pieces of music-software are made using old music sequencers called “music tracker”. Those trackers are very restrictive and limited compared to the modern D.A.W. Perhaps this is another reason that pushes hackers to introduce this type of music in the KeyGens. Is another way to show the supremacy over other hacking teams.
     </p>
     <h3>WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF KEYGEN MUSIC?</h3>
     <p>
This type of illegal art has origin from the Demo and Warez Scene dated back to the late 70s, when hackers started removing copy protection on Apple II ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC games and adding an intro splash screen with their tag name, greetings to friends and a piece of music as a celebration. This practice became standard in the hacking scene. It is not surprising that those songs fit into a little file as 10KB: back in the days the Amiga 1000 had 256KiB of stock chip RAM.
     </p>
     <p>		
It is possible to hear KeyGen music on platforms such as Youtube in improvised compilations made by fans of The Scene (the underground community specialised in the distribution of copyrighted materials). Other genres of music have been influenced by this particular sound, for example, Malcolm McLaren, the creator of Sex Pistols, in a period of his life when he got a sense of depressing sameness from technology and its surroundings, found inspiration from the unconventional and raw sound of chiptunes. This led him into an outdated studio in a forbidden and semi-abandoned factory in Ivry Sur Seine where got introduced to chip tunes productions through a particular indie rom for Game Boy that enables the composition of this type of music.
